# Calculator
In this project, I created a basic calculator with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This project
is part of the online curriculum [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator?ref=lnav) and is suitable for practicing functions, arrays and DOM manipulation.

## Challenges
At first, I thought this task would be rather easy, since only basic arithmetics are avalaible (addition, substraction, multiplication, and division). However, during the project some challenges has arisen:
- The user should be allowed to enter long equations
- The calculator should use correct precedence (multiplication and division before addition and substraction)
- The user should be allowed to correct his inputs (for example when he accidently clicks on the wrong operator)
- The user should be able to clear the data and deletes the last digit
- The user should be able to do calculations with negative numbers (e.g. -3 * 5)
- Users should be allowed to use decimal numbers (but only with one decimal point)
- Users should be able to make calculations with a previous result
- The calculator should look nice
